        13th Hour Gaming, often referred to as XIII, started off as a group of friends playing under the clan "Spawn Trapping" in Call of Duty: Ghosts. 
        They started turning heads and gaining attention from other clans in the scene and by the time Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare released, the best players joined another group of talented players to form "Oddly Vicious" 
        who went on to be number 3 in the world for clan wars. Once BO3 released, they took the best hardcore players from AW and slimmed down the active clan roster. 
        It was then that in 2015 that the original clan leader, Matt "AKADisaster" Seta, established the organization 13th Hour Gaming.

    <p style="color: white;">
        In early 2017, Alex "Mr. Astro" Rath decided that it would be best to branch out to more eSports instead of sticking to solely to Call of Duty, and with this decision, XIII picked up a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive roster. 
        The first era of 13th Hour CS:GO played in CEVO Intermediate and Season 26 of ESEA Open. That year saw a lot of roster changes and struggles even though the team was promoted to CEVO Main, they would remain in ESEA's Open Division for Season 27. 
        Through another year of roster struggles, the team would eventually push through and be promoted to ESEA Intermediate while also dropping out of all CEVO competition. 
        After making it to ESEA intermediate, half of the roster decided to leave for personal reasons leaving Gibby and Munchz, the two Canadian players, to find a new roster. 
        The two decided to stay local and merged with some Ottawa talent, a university team called the CarletonU Ravens. 
        The Ravens were a team who started to gather attention in Ottawa and the University scene, consisting of Mimic, Frosty, and Muffinatorz. In the beginning of season 28 of ESEA, Munchz was to enlist in the Canadian Armed Forces and had to leave the roster to prepare for his career. 
        The team then picked up a local In game leader, FeaR to help give them proper direction.

    <p style="color: white;">
        13th Hour Gaming's CS:GO Team is very quickly making a name for themselves while the organization has since gathered a large following on Twitter of 900+ followers and is forever expanding.
